## _Behavior Driven Design_

#### _If a user inputs a number, It will display that number._
* _Example:_
* _Input: 15_
* _Output: 15_


#### _If a user inputs a number, It will count up to that number by 1 using whole numbers._
* _Example:_
* _Input: 15_
* _Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15._


#### _If a user inputs a number, It will count up to that number by 1 using whole numbers. Each number that is divisible by 3 will be replaced by "ping"._
* _Example:_
* _Input: 15_
* _Output: 1,2,ping,4,5,ping,6,7,8,ping,10,11,ping,13,14,ping_


#### _If a user inputs a number, It will count up to that number by 1 using whole numbers. Each number that is divisible by 5 will be replaced by "pong"._
* _Example:_
* _Input: 15_
* _Output: 1,2,ping,4,pong,ping,6,7,8,ping,pong,11,ping,13,14,pong_


#### _If a user inputs a number, It will count up to that number by 1 using whole numbers. Each number that is divisible by 15 will be replaced by "pingpong"_
* _Example:_
* _Input: 15_
* _Output: 1,2,ping,4,pong,ping,6,7,8,ping,pong,11,ping,13,14,pingpong_
