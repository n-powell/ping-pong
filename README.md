BDD

Behavior Driven Design


If a user inputs a number, It will count up to that number by 1 using whole numbers.
Example:
Input: 15
Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.


If a user inputs a number, It will count up to that number by 1 using whole numbers. Each number that is divisible by 3 will be replaced by "ping".
Example:
Input: 15
Output: 1,2,ping,4,5,ping,6,7,8,ping,10,11,ping,13,14,ping


If a user inputs a number, It will count up to that number by 1 using whole numbers. Each number that is divisible by 5 will be replaced by "pong".
Example:
Input: 15
Output: 1,2,ping,4,pong,ping,6,7,8,ping,pong,11,ping,13,14,pong


If a user inputs a number, It will count up to that number by 1 using whole numbers. Each number that is divisible by 55 will be replaced by "pingpong"
Example:
Input: 15
Output: 1,2,ping,4,pong,ping,6,7,8,ping,pong,11,ping,13,14,pingpong
